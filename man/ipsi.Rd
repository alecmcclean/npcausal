\usage{
ipsi(y, a, x.trt, x.out, time, id, delta.seq, nsplits, ci_level = 0.95,
 progress_bar = TRUE, return_ifvals = FALSE, fit,
 sl.lib=c("SL.earth","SL.gam","SL.glm","SL.glmnet","SL.glm.interaction", "SL.mean","SL.ranger","rpart"))
}
\arguments{
\item{y}{Outcome of interest measured at end of study.}

\item{a}{Binary treatment.}

\item{x.trt}{Covariate matrix for treatment regression.}

\item{x.out}{Covariate matrix for outcome regression.}

\item{time}{Measurement time.}

\item{id}{Subject identifier.}

\item{delta.seq}{Sequence of delta increment values for incremental
propensity score intervention.}

\item{nsplits}{Integer number of sample splits for nuisance estimation. If
\code{nsplits = 1}, sample splitting is not used, and nuisance functions are
estimated n full sample (in which case validity of standard errors and
confidence intervals requires empirical process conditions). Otherwise must
have \code{nsplits > 1}.}

\item{ci_level}{A \code{numeric} value giving the level (1 - alpha) of the
confidence interval to be computed around the point estimate.}

\item{progress_bar}{A \code{logical} value indicating whether to print a
customized progress bar as various stages of computation reach completion.
The default is \code{TRUE}, printing a progress bar to inform the user.}

\item{return_ifvals}{A \code{logical} indicating whether the estimated
observation-level values of the influence function ought to be returned as
part of the output object. The default is \code{FALSE} as these values are
rarely of interest in standard usage.}

\item{fit}{How nuisance functions should be estimated. Options are "rf" for
random forests via the \code{ranger} package, or "sl" for super learner.}

\item{sl.lib}{sl.lib algorithm library for SuperLearner.
Default library includes "earth", "gam", "glm", "glmnet", "glm.interaction",
"mean", "ranger", "rpart.}
}
\value{
A list containing the following components:
\item{res}{ estimates/SEs and uniform CIs for population means.}
\item{res.ptwise}{ estimates/SEs and pointwise CIs for population means.}
\item{calpha}{ multiplier bootstrap critical value.}
}
\description{
\code{ipsi} is used to estimate effects of incremental
 propensity score interventions, i.e., estimates of mean outcomes if the odds
 of receiving treatment were multiplied by a factor delta.

\section{Details}{

Treatment and covariates are expected to be time-varying and measured
throughout the course of the study. Therefore if \code{n} is the number of
subjects and \code{T} the number of timepoints, then \code{a}, \code{time},
and \code{id} should all be vectors of length \code{n}x\code{T}, and
\code{x.trt} and \code{x.out} should be matrices with \code{n}x\code{T} rows.
However \code{y} should be a vector of length \code{n} since it is only
measured at the end of the study. The subject ordering should be consistent
across function inputs, based on the ordering specified by \code{id}. See
example below for an illustration.

\examples{
n <- 500
T <- 4

time <- rep(1:T, n)
id <- rep(1:n, rep(T, n))
x.trt <- matrix(rnorm(n * T * 5), nrow = n * T)
x.out <- matrix(rnorm(n * T * 5), nrow = n * T)
a <- rbinom(n * T, 1, .5)
y <- rnorm(mean=1,n)

d.seq <- seq(0.1, 5, length.out = 10)

ipsi.res <- ipsi(y, a, x.trt, x.out, time, id, d.seq)
